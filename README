Thanks a lot to Bartosz Kie≈Çczewski for his springboot tutorial (see : http://kielczewski.eu/2014/04/developing-restful-web-service-with-spring-boot/)
I added these topics :

1) I replaced maven configuration by gradle.
2) I created an ExampleController to test a POC with 2 differents services. This controller return an "Hello World"
3) I completed the UserController to achieve a restful-web-service with the POST-PUT-GET-DELETE method.

You can start the application with the "gradle bootRun" command line
I advice to test the application with the postman chrome plugin
